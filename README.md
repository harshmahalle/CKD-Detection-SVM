Developed a web application that predicts Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques and Flask web framework. 

The project involved:

Data Handling & Preprocessing: Processed medical data using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, performed data cleaning, and encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

Machine Learning Model: Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict CKD based on specific health indicators like serum creatinine, hemoglobin levels, and more, achieving high accuracy.

Web Development with Flask: Implemented a user-friendly interface using Flask, allowing users to input health parameters for CKD prediction and displaying the likelihood of the disease.

Performance Evaluation: Employed evaluation metrics like recall, precision, and F1-score to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

This project showcases skills in machine learning, Python programming, data preprocessing, and web development. It demonstrates our ability to integrate machine learning models into practical web applications
for healthcare prediction tasks.
